# Automated Machine Learning

This project contains the performance comparisons of Automated machine learning tools( Auto-WEKA, TPOT)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites for TPOT
```
Python 3.6,  Anaconde Navigator latest version or Jupyter notebook
```
```
You can also work with whole project from ternimal if you are more comfortable with it.
```
### Installation and Setup for TPOT
```
Simply install Python and Anaconda Navigator into your machine.
```
```
Additional Libraries: You mught have to download additional libraries to run the codes. Please install the required libraires mostly using pip command.
```
## Running the tests
Open the Jupyter notebook into your browser through Anaconda Navigator window. Upload the file using upload button on the right of Jupyter notebook console. Once the file is uploaded, select the code and press run cell button or run it using ctrl+enter using your keyboard. Code can take time for compilation. You have to wait for the final results.
### Prerequisites for Auto-WEKA: 
```
Weka 3.8 or any latest version,  Auto-Weka Package, Datascience and machine learning concepts
```
### Installation and Setup for Auto-Weka
```
Install the Weka and go to Tools and click on Package Manager. Once it is open, search for Auto-WEKA package and download it. Close the 
package manager window and click on Explorer tab from Weka's window. Here you can see Auto-WEKA as a separate tab or you can access it from Weka classifeir list from classify tab.
```
## Running the tests
To run a test, you need and arff file of your dataset. You can convert a csv file of your dataset inside the Weka. Upload the arff file and go to Auto-WEKA tab. Here you will find Auto-WEKA parameters with predefined values. You can also change the values as required or leave them as default for your first experiment. Then click on Run button and wait for Auto-WEKA to do its job.
